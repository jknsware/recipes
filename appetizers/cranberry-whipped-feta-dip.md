### Ingredients List

1. 1/3 c orange juice, plus 1 tsp finely grated orange zest
1. 2 tbsp honey, divided
1. 1 c fresh cranberries
1. 1 sprig thyme, plus 2 tsp chopped thyme leaves
1. 6 oz feta in brine, cut into small cubes
1. 1 clove garlic, grated or minced
1. 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
1. 6 oz cream cheese, room temperature
1. 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1. 2 tbsp toasted chopped pistachios
1. Crackers or crostini for serving

### Directions

1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, whisk orange juice and 1 tablespoon honey until combined, then bring to a boil. Add cranberries and thyme sprig and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until cranberries burst and become saucy, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove thyme and stir in orange zest. Let cool. 
1. Meanwhile, drain brine from feta. In a food processor, pulse feta, garlic, red pepper flakes, and chopped thyme until feta is broken up into small crumbs. Add cream cheese and pulse until combined. With motor running, drizzle in oil and blend until mixture is smooth and fluffy. 
1. Transfer whipped feta to a serving bowl. Top with cooled cranberry sauce. Sprinkle with pistachios and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon honey. Serve with crackers alongside.
