# Texas Style Chili

### Ingredients List

1. 7 lbs beef, ground, cubed, or a mix
1. 3/4 cup olive oil
1. 3 ounces of tequila
1. 15 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1. 3/4 cup flour
1. 1/2 cup chili powder
1. 1 bottle of beer
1. 3 ounces of blackstrap molasses
1. 1 tablespoon Mexican oregano
1. 2 tablespoons cumin
1. 5 ounces jarred jalapenos with juice
1. Dash ginger
1. Dash nutmeg
1. 1 teaspoon white pepper
1. 1 tablespoon chipotle powder
1. 7 cups beef broth, divided into 5 cups and 2 cups
1. Salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Place beef in a Dutch oven (or similar large pot) with olive oil and cook on low heat until browned.
1. Add tequila and stir.
1. Add garlic and stir.
1. Slowly adda mixture of the flour and chili powder, stirring constantly to blend in evenly.
1. Add beer and stir.
1. Add molasses and stir.
1. Add cumin and orrgano by rubbing them between the palms of your hands and stir.
1. Add peppers and remaining spices and stir.
1. Add 5 cups of beef broth and stir.
1. Bring to a slow boil for 30 minutes, then lower heat and simmer. Stir occasionally and scrap up any bits that stick to the bottom.
1. After simmering for two hours or until broth has evaporated, a decision has to be made. Either remove from heat, let cool, and then place in the fridge for 12+ hours or eat it now. Chilling and recooking adds a ton of flavor but understandable if you can't wait.
1. Resume cooking on low heat. When nearly at a chili-like consistency, add the remaining beef broth and then stir.
1. Cook and stir for another two hours and then serve.
