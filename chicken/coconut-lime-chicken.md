### Ingredients List

1. 2 large chicken breasts cut into 1" pieces
1. 1/2 medium onion chopped
1. 2 tablespoons olive oil
1. 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1. Salt & pepper to taste
1. 3 cloves garlic minced
1. 1 teaspoon fresh ginger minced
1. 1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk (full fat)
1. 1 tablespoon lime juice + zest of 1 lime
1. 1 teaspoon brown sugar
1. 1 small handful fresh basil chopped (or more, to taste)
1. 1 small handful fresh cilantro chopped (or more, to taste)
1. 1 small handful scallions chopped (or more, to taste)

### Directions

1. Cut up the chicken into bite-size pieces and sprinkle them with the garlic powder and some salt & pepper (I just do this right on the cutting board).
1. Chop the onion then add it to a deep skillet over medium-high heat along with the olive oil. Saut√© for 5 minutes.
1. Add the chicken to the pan and cook it for about 5 minutes (stir it occasionally). Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.
1. Stir in the garlic and ginger, and cook for 30 seconds.
1. Add in the coconut milk (shake the can first), lime juice + zest, and sugar. Reduce the heat to medium and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes or until the sauce is somewhat reduced. This won't be a thick sauce, but reducing does help concentrate flavors and thicken it up a bit.
1. Add the chicken back into the pan and cook for a few more minutes. Stir in the cilantro, basil, and scallions right before serving. Season with extra salt & pepper as needed. This dish goes well with rice. I serve it with extra lime wedges (and you can top each bowl with extra cilantro/basil/scallions too if you wish).
