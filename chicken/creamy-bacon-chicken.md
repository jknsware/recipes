[Recipe Link](https://www.saltandlavender.com/creamy-bacon-chicken/)

### Ingredients List

1. 6 strips bacon cut into small pieces
1. 2 large chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise
1. Flour for dredging
1. 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1. Pepper to taste
1. 1/2 cup chicken broth
1. 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1. 1 tablespoon butter
1. 1 cup heavy/whipping cream

### Directions

1. Cut the bacon up and add it to a skillet (I use kitchen shears to make this job quick). Fry it over medium-high heat until crispy (about 10 mins). Once the bacon is done, take it out of the pan and set it aside. Leave the bacon fat in the pan.
1. Meanwhile, prep your chicken (cut it in half lengthwise so you have 4 smaller cutlets). Sprinkle them with the garlic powder and pepper and then coat them in the flour.
1. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook it in the remaining bacon fat over medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes/side or until it's golden. If it starts to splatter a lot, reduce the heat. Once the chicken is browned, take it out of the pan and set it aside.
1. Add the chicken broth, lemon juice, and butter to the pan. Let it bubble until it's reduced by half (about 3-4 minutes).
1. Stir in the cream and once it starts to bubble, add the chicken and bacon back into the pan. Cook for another 5 minutes or so until the chicken is fully cooked through and the sauce has reduced to your liking.
