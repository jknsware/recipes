### Ingredients List

1. 2 large chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise
1. Salt to taste
1. Pepper to taste
1. 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1. Flour (for dredging)
1. 4 tablespoons butter divided
1. 1 tablespoon olive oil
1. 1/4 cup chicken broth or dry white wine
1. 1 tablespoon lemon juice + zest of 1 lemon
1. 1 tablespoon brined capers drained
1. 1/2 cup heavy/whipping cream
1. Garnish (optional) chopped parsley and freshly grated parmesan cheese

### Directions

1. Slice chicken breasts lengthwise to make 4 thinner cutlets. Trim off any fat. Season chicken generously with salt and pepper and sprinkle with garlic powder. Coat the chicken in flour.

1. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter plus the olive oil to a skillet over medium-high heat.

1. Once the pan is hot, cook the chicken pieces for about 4-5 minutes per side until golden.

1. Remove the chicken from skillet and set aside.

1. Take the pan off the heat and add the the chicken broth, lemon juice, lemon zest, remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, and capers to the skillet. Scrape up any brown bits.

1. Stir in the cream and return the pan to the heat. Once it's bubbling again, add the chicken back into the pan.

1. Cook for another 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has reduced to your liking (you may need to turn down the heat a bit if it's bubbling furiously). If the sauce thickens too much, add more broth.

1. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and parmesan cheese.
