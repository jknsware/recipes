### Ingredients List

For the peanut sauce:
1. 3 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce
1. 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice (from 1 lime)
1. 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1. 2 teaspoons honey
1. 1/2 teaspoon sambal oelek or Asian chili-garlic paste
1. 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter, preferably regular and not natural
1. 2 tablespoons toasted (Asian) sesame oil

For the bowls:
1. 1 cup quinoa, rinsed well
1. 1 3/4 cups water
1. 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1. 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
1. 2 tablespoons olive oil
1. 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1. 2 cups finely shredded purple cabbage
1. 1 cup shredded carrot
1. 1/2 medium English cucumber, thinly sliced
1. 1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems
1. 1/4 cup unsalted roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped
1. Lime wedges, for serving

### Directions

For the peanut sauce:
1. Place the tamari or soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, honey, and chile-garlic paste in a pint-sized glass jar, seal, and shake to combine. Add the peanut butter and sesame oil. Seal again and shake vigorously until well combined, about 30 seconds; set aside. (Alternatively, whisk together in a medium bowl.)

For the bowls:
1. Place the quinoa, water, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high. 
1. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender and all the liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. 
1. Remove the pot from the heat and set aside to steam for 5 minutes. Fluff the quinoa with a fork.
1. Meanwhile, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season with the pepper and remaining 1 teaspoon salt.
1. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet (preferably nonstick) over medium-high until shimmering. 
1. Add the chicken in a single layer and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. 
1. Add 3 tablespoons of the peanut sauce and stir to coat the chicken; set aside.
1. Divide the quinoa between 4 bowls. Top with the chicken, cabbage, carrot, cucumber, cilantro, and peanuts, then drizzle with the remaining peanut sauce. Serve with lime wedges.
