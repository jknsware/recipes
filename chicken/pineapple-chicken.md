### Ingredients List

1. 2 chicken breasts cut into 1" pieces
1. 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1. Pepper to taste
1. 3 tablespoons cornstarch
1. 3 tablespoons olive oil divided
1. 2 (8 fluid ounce) cans pineapple tidbits or chunks drained (but reserve 3/4 cup juice for the sauce)
1. 1/2 red bell pepper cut into bite-size pieces
1. 1/2 medium onion sliced or cut into bite-size pieces

Sauce:
1. 3/4 cup pineapple juice (from the canned pineapple)
1. 3 tablespoons honey
1. 2 tablespoons soy sauce
1. 1 teaspoon rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)
1. 1 teaspoon fresh ginger grated
1. 2 cloves garlic minced
1. 1 tablespoon cornstarch

### Directions

1. Add the sauce ingredients to a small bowl. If you don't have quite enough pineapple juice to make 3/4 cup, just top the rest up with water. Whisk until smooth.

1. Prep your veggies.

1. Cut the chicken into 1" pieces and add them to a bowl. Toss them with the garlic powder and some pepper. Add the cornstarch and toss until coated.

1. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Let the pan heat up for a few minutes. Cook the chicken in two batches (don't crowd the pan). Cook the chicken for 4 minutes and then flip (I use tongs to do this quickly) and cook for another 3-4 minutes or so. Chicken should be browned and cooked through (165F). For the second batch, I add another tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Transfer each batch of the chicken to a plate when it's done.

1. If the pan is dry, add a small splash of olive oil (a teaspoon or so), and then add the pineapple. Let it cook without stirring it for about a minute.

1. Stir in the peppers and onions and cook for another 3 minutes or so, stirring occasionally. Veggies will be tender-crisp. You can cook for a little longer if you wish.

1. Add the chicken back to the pan and then stir in the sauce. Let it bubble until it's thickened (about 1-2 minutes), then take the pan off the heat and serve immediately over rice or noodles.
