### Ingredients List

1. 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 4)
1. 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1. 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1. 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1. 3 cloves garlic, minced
1. 1 (15-ounce) jar Alfredo sauce, such as Rao’s or Bertolli’s
1. 1/2 cup water
1. 1 cup thinly sliced sun-dried tomatoes, patted dry if oil-packed
1. 4 cups packed baby spinach leaves (4 ounces)
1. 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice

### Directions

1. Place 1 chicken breast inside a gallon zip-top bag and pound with the flat side of a meat mallet or rolling pin to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Set aside and repeat with remaining chicken breasts. 
1. Season both sides of the chicken breasts with the salt and pepper.
1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. 
1. Working in two batches, place the chicken in the pan and sear until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes.
1. Transfer the chicken seared-side up to a 5-quart or larger slow cooker in an even layer, overlapping slightly as needed. 
1. Scatter the garlic and sun-dried tomatoes over the chicken. 
1. Pour in the Alfredo sauce and water; gently stir to make sure the sun-dried tomatoes are submerged.
1. Cover and cook on the LOW setting until the chicken is cooked through, tender, and registers an internal temperature of 165°F, about 2 hours. 
1. Uncover and stir in the spinach. Cover and cook until just wilted, about 5 minutes.
1. Turn off the slow cooker and stir in the lemon juice. 
1. Serve the chicken over cooked pasta, if desired.
