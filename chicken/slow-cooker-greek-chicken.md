### Ingredients List

1. 2 tbsp olive oil or avocado oil
1. 3 cloves garlic
1. 2 lbs chicken thighs boneless, skinless
1. 1/2 tsp salt
1. 1/4 tsp pepper (can use lemon pepper)
1. 1 12 oz jar marinated roasted red peppers drained and diced
1. 1 8 oz jar marinated artichoke hearts drained
1. 1 cup kalamata olives
1. 1/2 medium red onion sliced
1. 2/3 cup chicken broth
1. 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1. 1/2 lemon juiced
1. 1 tsp dried oregano
1. 1 tsp dried thyme
1. 1-2 tbsp arrowroot starch
1. tbsp fresh basil chopped
1. 1/2 cup crumbled feta optional

### Directions

1. Begin by heating a skillet to medium high heat. While skillet is heating, salt and pepper each side of your chicken thighs. Add oil to the hot skillet, then crushed garlic. Cook for 1 minute, now add chicken. Sear chicken on each side for about 2 minutes (no need to cook all the way through).
1. Place chicken on the bottom of your slow cooker. Now arrange the artichoke hearts, peppers, and olives around the chicken filling in the gaps on the bottom of your slow cooker. Top with sliced red onion.
1. In a bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of chicken broth (don't need the full 2/3 for slow cooker), vinegar, lemon, dried oregano, and dried thyme. Pour on top of the chicken/vegetable mixture. Place lid on top. 
1. Cover and cook for 4 hours on low or 2-3 hours on high. Remove lid.
1. Spoon out some of the juice into a small bowl once cooking is complete. Add 1 tbsp of arrowroot starch to the juice, whisk, and pour back into the slow cooker. Allow the sauce to thicken for another 15-20 minutes before serving.
1. Serve over potatoes, rice, or cauliflower rice. Top with fresh herbs, sprinkle with additional salt and pepper, and optional feta.
