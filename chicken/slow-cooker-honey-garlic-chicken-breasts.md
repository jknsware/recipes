### Ingredients List

1. 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 pounds total)
1. 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1. 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1. 1 tablespoon olive oil
1. 1/2 cup honey
1. 2 tablespoons ketchup
1. 1 tablespoon low-sodium tamari or soy sauce
1. 5 cloves garlic, minced
1. Sesame seeds and sliced scallions, for serving

### Directions

1. Season the chicken all over with the salt and pepper. 
1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. 
1. Add the chicken and sear until the bottoms are browned, 5 to 6 minutes. 
1. Transfer the chicken to a 6-quart or larger slow cooker seared-side up, doing your best to arrange in a single layer, though you may need to overlap them slightly.
1. Whisk the honey, ketchup, tamari or soy sauce, and garlic together in a small bowl. Pour over the chicken.
1. Cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through and registers an internal temperature of 165Â°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 2 hours on the LOW setting or about 1 hour on the HIGH setting.
1. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board to rest.
1. Pour the sauce in the slow cooker into a wide skillet or saucepan. 
1. Cook over medium heat until darkened in color, thickened slightly, and reduced by about 1/3, about 5 minutes.
1. Pour the sauce over the chicken and top with sesame seeds and thinly sliced green onions, if desired.
