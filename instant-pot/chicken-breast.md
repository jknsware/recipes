### Ingredients List

1. 3 pounds fresh or frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 4 large breasts)
1. 1 teaspoon kosher salt
1. 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth or water

### Directions

1. Arrange the chicken, salt, and water in the electric pressure cooker. Set the Instant Pot’s trivet or a steamer basket inside the insert of a 6-quart or larger Instant Pot or electric pressure cooker. Season the chicken with the salt and set on the trivet. Pour the chicken broth or water over the chicken.

1. For perfectly juicy chicken breast: Cook the chicken on HIGH pressure for 10 minutes and quick release the pressure. Seal the cooker and make sure the pressure valve is closed. Set to MANUAL, HIGH, and dial the time down to 10 minutes. For fresh chicken, it will take about 10 minutes to come to pressure. Expect frozen chicken to take 12 to 15 minutes to come up to pressure. When the 10-minute cook time is up, do a QUICK release of pressure.

1. For shredded chicken: Cook the chicken on HIGH pressure for 15 minutes and natural release for 5 minutes. For chicken that shreds easily with a fork, you’ll need just a few more minutes of cooking and natural release. Cover the electric pressure and set to MANUAL, HIGH, and dial the time down to 15 minutes. For fresh chicken, the cooker will take about 10 minutes to come to pressure. Expect frozen chicken to take 12 to 15 minutes to come to pressure. When the 15 minute cook time is up, do a NATURAL release of pressure for 5 minutes before quick releasing any remaining pressure.

1. Release remaining pressure, remove and serve or use for future use. Immediately transfer the chicken to a cutting board. If reserving the cooked chicken for meals throughout the week, store the breasts whole to keep them moist. Chop or shred the chicken as desired for immediate use in other recipes. Reserve the broth for soups and cooking grains.

### Recipe Notes

Frozen chicken
This method works well with frozen chicken as well, just keep in mind that frozen breasts cool the cooker’s insert and make for a longer cooker time, as the pressure cooker needs more time to come to pressure.
