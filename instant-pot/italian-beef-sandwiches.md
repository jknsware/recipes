### Ingredients List

For the beef
1. 2 teaspoons dried oregano
1. 1 teaspoon dried basil
1. 1 teaspoon onion powder
1. 1 teaspoon paprika
1. 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1. 1 teaspoon kosher salt (omit if using salted beef broth)
1. 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1. 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1. 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1. 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1. 3 pounds beef chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 2-inch cubes
1. 1 tablespoon olive oil
1. 1 small onion, thinly sliced
1. 3 cloves garlic, minced or put through a garlic press
1. 2 cups beef broth, preferably unsalted

For the sautéed green peppers: (optional)
1. 2 teaspoons olive oil
1. 2 medium green bell peppers, cored and sliced
1. Kosher salt
1. Freshly ground black pepper

For the sandwiches:
1. 6 (6-inch) crusty sub or sandwich rolls
1. Sliced provolone, cheddar, or American cheese (optional)
1. Giardiniera or pepperoncini peppers (optional)

### Directions

1. Make the beef: Place the oregano, basil, onion powder, paprika, black pepper, salt, rosemary, thyme, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder in a small bowl and stir to combine.

1. Place the cubed beef in a large bowl. Sprinkle with the spice blend and toss to combine and coat the cubes evenly.

1. Heat the oil in the insert of an electric pressure cooker on the sauté setting until shimmering. (If your pressure cooker does not have a sauté setting, do this in a small frying pan.) Add the onions and sauté until tender, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute more.

1. Turn off the sauté setting, add the beef, and stir to combine. Add the beef broth. Lock the lid into place. Cook on high pressure for 35 minutes. Meanwhile, if making the sautéed green peppers, cook them now.

1. For the sautéed green peppers: Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the bell peppers and sauté until tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside until the sandwiches are ready to be assembled.

1. Finish the beef: Once the cooking time is complete, turn the machine off. Do not let it switch to warm. Allow the pressure to release naturally; this will take about 20 minutes. Unlock the lid and test the meat. It should be fork-tender; if it isn't, replace the lid and cook for an additional 5 minutes under high pressure, followed by a 10-minute natural release.

1. Transfer the beef to a large bowl and shred with 2 forks. Return the shredded beef to the pressure cooker insert.

1. Make the sandwiches: Split the rolls. Fill with cheese if using. (For melted cheese, place the split rolls topped with cheese under the broiler until the cheese melts, about 1 minute.) Spoon the shredded beef onto the sandwich. Top with giardiniera, pepperoncini, or sautéed green peppers.

1. Ladle on some of the cooking liquid or serve with the cooking liquid in individual bowls for dunking. Alternatively, dip the entire sandwich: Use a pair of tongs to dip the sandwich carefully into the cooking liquid, which will be quite hot. Serve immediately.
