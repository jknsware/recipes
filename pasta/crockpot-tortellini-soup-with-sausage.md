### Ingredients List

1. 1 package Italian sausage
1. 1/2 medium onion chopped
1. 2 medium carrots chopped
1. 2 stick celery chopped
1. 4 cloves garlic minced
1. 1 28 fluid ounce can crushed tomatoes
1. 1 14 fluid ounce can diced tomatoes with juices
1. 4 cups chicken broth
1. 2 9 ounce packages refrigerated cheese tortellini
1. 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1. 2 cups packed fresh baby spinach
1. Salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Take your sausages out of their casings and crumble them into a skillet. Add the chopped onion. Saut√© for about 7 minutes. Add the garlic in towards the end so it doesn't burn. Spoon out most of the fat (you don't need to be precise... fat gives the soup more flavor). Add the sausage mixture to your Crockpot.
1. Meanwhile, chop your carrots and celery. Add all ingredients except for the tortellini, spinach, cream, and salt & pepper to the Crockpot. Keep in mind that if you want the soup to cook in 3-4 hours, the carrots will have to be chopped pretty finely. If you're cooking it for 7-8 on low or 4-5 hours on high, you can chop them larger.
1. About 30 minutes prior to serving, add in your cheese tortellini, cream, and spinach. Give it a stir occasionally. Season with salt & pepper as needed prior to serving.
