### Ingredients List

1. 8.8 ounces Italian sausages (cut into bite-size pieces) see recipe notes
1. 1/2 small onion chopped finely
1. 4 cloves garlic minced
1. 1/3 cup dry white wine (e.g. sauvignon blanc)
1. 1 (14 fluid ounce) can diced tomatoes with juices
1. 1 cup heavy/whipping cream
1. 1 pound uncooked potato gnocchi
1. 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
1. Handful fresh basil torn
1. Salt & pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Prep your sausage and onion. Feel free to take the sausage meat out of the casing if that's easier than cutting it.
1. Sauté the sausage pieces and onion in a skillet on on medium-high heat for 7-10 minutes, or until the sausage and onions are lightly browned.
1. Add the garlic to the pan and sauté for 30 seconds, or until fragrant.
1. Add the wine and let it cook for about a minute.
1. Stir in the diced tomatoes, cream, and gnocchi. Once the sauce starts to bubble again, cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Cook for 5 minutes.
1. Uncover the pan, give it a good stir, and let it cook for another few minutes, or until the gnocchi has cooked through and is nice and soft and the sauce has thickened to your liking.
1. Stir in the parmesan cheese, basil, and salt & pepper, to taste. Serve immediately.
