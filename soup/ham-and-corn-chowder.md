### Ingredients List

1. 4 strips bacon cut into small pieces
1. 1/2 medium onion chopped
1. 2 sticks celery chopped
1. 1/4 cup flour
1. 2 cloves garlic minced
1. 4 cups chicken broth or stock
1. 1 cup heavy/whipping cream
1. 2 cups frozen corn
1. 1 pound smoked ham chopped
1. 2 large Russet potatoes peeled & diced
1. 1 dash Italian seasoning
1. 1 pinch cayenne pepper optional
1. Salt & pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Prep your bacon (I use kitchen shears to make cutting it up easy) and add it to a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook until crispy (about 10 minutes).

1. Meanwhile, prep your onion, celery, ham, and potatoes. 

1. Once the bacon is crispy, take it out of the pot and remove to a paper towel lined plate. Leave the bacon fat in the pot. 

1. Add the onion and celery to the pot and saut√© for 5 minutes.

1. Stir in the flour and cook for about a minute, stirring nearly constantly.

1. Add in the garlic, followed by the chicken broth. Give it a good stir to ensure the flour has dissolved and the flavorful brown bits are scraped up from the bottom of the pot. 

1. Add in the cream, corn, ham, potatoes, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, and most of the bacon (I save the rest for garnishing the bowls later on). Increase the heat to high and bring the soup to a boil. Once it's boiling, reduce the heat to a rapid simmer so it's gently boiling. 

1. Cook until the potatoes are tender (about 15-20 minutes). Stir every so often. The soup will get thicker the longer you cook it.

1. Season the soup with salt & pepper if needed. Garnish with the rest of the bacon.
