### Ingredients List

1. 2 sticks celery chopped finely
1. 2 medium carrots peeled & chopped finely
1. 1/2 medium onion chopped
1. 1 tablespoon butter
1. 1 tablespoon olive oil
1. 3 cloves garlic minced
1. 2 tablespoons flour
1. 6 cups chicken broth
1. 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1. 1.5 pounds uncooked chicken breasts
1. 1 cup uncooked orzo
1. 1 tablespoon lemon juice or to taste
1. 1 tablespoon chopped parsley or to taste
1. Salt & pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Saut√© the celery, carrots, and onions in a large soup pot with the butter and oil over medium-high heat for 5-7 minutes.

1. Stir in the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, then add the flour and cook for another minute or so.

1. Pour in chicken broth and stir until the flour has dissolved, then add the Italian seasoning and chicken. Bring the soup to a boil.

1. Cover the soup (lid slightly ajar), and reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.

1. Stir in the orzo and cook for another 10 minutes or until the orzo is cooked through. I keep the lid off and stir it fairly often because it tends to stick to the bottom of the pot.

1. Take the chicken out of the pot and cut it up, then add it back in. Add the lemon juice (you may want to add more than I suggest - I didn't want to make the soup too lemony for some people), parsley, and season the soup with salt & pepper as needed. Serve immediately.
