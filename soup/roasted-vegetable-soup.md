### Ingredients List

1. 1 large zucchini, halved and sliced into 1/4-inch half-moons
1. 1 large yellow squash, halved and sliced into 1/4-inch half-moons
1. 1 large yellow onion, halved and sliced thin
1. 1 medium orange bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1. 1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1. 1/4 cup olive oil
1. 1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano
1. 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
1. 2 teaspoons kosher salt
1. 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1. 3 cloves garlic, minced
1. 4 cups chicken stock
1. One 14.5-ounce can stewed tomatoes
1. 1 cup heavy cream
1. 1 bay leaf
1. Juice of 1/2 lemon
1. 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.
1. Add the zucchini, yellow squash, onion and bell peppers to a large mixing bowl and toss with the olive oil, oregano, thyme, salt, pepper and garlic until coated. Divide the vegetables between 2 baking sheets and arrange them in a single layer. Roast, turning the vegetables halfway through, until they start to deepen in color and are slightly tender, about 10 minutes.
1. Add the roasted vegetables to the bowl of a slow cooker along with the stock, stewed tomatoes, cream and bay leaf. Set the slow cooker to low and cook for 3 hours.
1. Remove the bay leaf, add the lemon juice and, using an immersion blender, pulse to blend the soup until you achieve a smooth and rustic texture. Stir, taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.
1. Serve in a bowl garnished with the chopped parsley. If freezing, cool the mixture completely, then transfer to freezer-safe bags, seal and place in freezer.
